# inmobiliariaWeb
A little website for registering homes on a database.

Built in PHP, the web connects to a MySQL database.
It allows register new homes attaching a photo, delete, filter by features or modify data.

I also attach to the directory an .sql file with the database example content exported from phpmyadmin.
